### What I learned

I learned to not lean on state so much when I can do computation/filtering during rendering instead. My initial prototype maintained 3 different arrays of country data as state (all countries, regional countries and displayed countries). I reduced this to only maintain all countries that I keep in local storage (with a reduced data footprint) and display main country blocks using just that data.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
